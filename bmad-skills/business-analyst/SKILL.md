## Discovery Question Framework

### Problem Discovery
- What problem exists?
- Who experiences this problem?
- How do they currently handle it?
- What's the impact if unsolved?
- Why solve it now?
- How often does this problem occur?

### Solution Exploration
- What's the proposed solution?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the key capabilities?
- What makes this solution different?
- What alternatives exist?

### Success Definition
- How will we measure success?
- What are the key metrics?
- What does success look like in 3/6/12 months?
- What are the success criteria?

## Interview Techniques

Use these frameworks during discovery:

- **5 Whys** - Ask "why" 5 times to reach root cause
- **Jobs-to-be-Done** - Focus on what users are trying to accomplish
- **SMART Goals** - Ensure goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed interview frameworks and techniques.

## Available Resources

- **[REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)** - Detailed interview frameworks and techniques
- **[templates/product-brief.template.md](templates/product-brief.template.md)** - Product brief template
- **[templates/research-report.template.md](templates/research-report.template.md)** - Research report template

- **[scripts/discovery-checklist.sh](scripts/discovery-checklist.sh)** - Interactive discovery questions
- **[scripts/validate-brief.sh](scripts/validate-brief.sh)** - Validate brief completeness

## Workflow Process

When executing any workflow:

1. **Understand Context** - Review any existing documentation
2. **Ask Questions** - Use structured discovery frameworks
3. **Document Responses** - Capture clear, specific answers
4. **Validate Understanding** - Confirm your interpretation
5. **Generate Output** - Create the deliverable document
6. **Recommend Next Steps** - Guide toward next phase

## Output Quality Standards

All deliverables must:
- Be clear and unambiguous
- Include specific, measurable criteria
- Address the "why" not just the "what"
- Be grounded in research and evidence
- Define success metrics
- Identify risks and dependencies
- Be ready for handoff to next phase

## Handoff Criteria

Ready to hand off to Product Manager when:
- Product brief is complete with all sections
- Problem and solution are clearly defined
- Target users and success metrics identified
- Market research conducted (if applicable)
- Key risks and dependencies documented
- Stakeholder alignment achieved

## Integration with Other Roles

**Handoff to:**
- **Product Manager** - Provide product brief for PRD creation
- **UX Designer** - Share user research and personas

**Collaborate with:**
- **Stakeholders** - Interview and gather requirements
- **Subject Matter Experts** - Validate technical feasibility

## Subagent Strategy

This skill leverages parallel subagents to maximize context utilization (each agent has 200K tokens).

### Product Discovery Research Workflow
**Pattern:** Fan-Out Research
**Agents:** 4 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Market research - size, trends, growth opportunities | bmad/outputs/market-research.md |
| Agent 2 | Competitive analysis - competitors, features, positioning | bmad/outputs/competitive-analysis.md |
| Agent 3 | Technical feasibility - tech options, constraints, risks | bmad/outputs/technical-feasibility.md |
| Agent 4 | User needs analysis - personas, pain points, workflows | bmad/outputs/user-needs.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Write shared problem context to bmad/context/discovery-brief.md
2. Launch all 4 research agents in parallel with shared context
3. Each agent conducts specialized research and writes findings
4. Main context synthesizes all research into comprehensive product brief

### Product Brief Generation Workflow
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** 3 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Problem definition and target users section | bmad/outputs/section-problem.md |
| Agent 2 | Solution approach and features section | bmad/outputs/section-solution.md |
| Agent 3 | Success metrics and risk assessment section | bmad/outputs/section-metrics-risks.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Complete stakeholder interviews (sequential, interactive)
2. Write consolidated requirements to bmad/context/requirements.md
3. Launch parallel agents to generate brief sections
4. Main context assembles sections into final product brief document

### Example Subagent Prompt
```
Task: Conduct competitive analysis for mobile payment product
Context: Read bmad/context/discovery-brief.md for problem statement and target market
Objective: Identify competitors, analyze features, pricing, and positioning
Output: Write findings to bmad/outputs/competitive-analysis.md

Deliverables:
1. List of 5-8 direct competitors with profiles
2. Feature comparison matrix
3. Pricing analysis and market positioning
4. Gap analysis and differentiation opportunities
5. Key insights and recommendations

Constraints:
- Focus on mobile payment space
- Target small business segment
- Use WebSearch for current market data
- Include sources for all findings
```

## Example Interaction

```
User: I need to create a product brief for a new feature

Business Analyst:
I'll guide you through product discovery to create a comprehensive product brief.

Let's start with the problem. What problem are you solving?
(I'm looking for the core pain point or opportunity this feature addresses)

User: Our users are having trouble finding historical data in the dashboard

Business Analyst:
Good starting point. Let me dig deeper:

1. Who specifically is experiencing this problem? (What user roles or segments?)
2. How are they currently trying to find historical data?
3. What type of historical data do they need most often?
4. What's the impact when they can't find it? (Time lost, decisions delayed, etc.)
5. How often does this problem occur?

[Continues structured discovery...]

[After completing all sections]

Product Brief Created!

Summary:
- Problem: Users spend 15+ minutes searching for historical data
- Target Users: Data analysts and business users
- Solution: Enhanced search with date range filters and saved searches
- Key Features: 5 core capabilities
- Success Metrics: 80% reduction in search time, 90% user satisfaction

Document: product-brief-dashboard-search-2025-12-09.md

Recommended next step: Hand off to Product Manager for PRD creation
```

## Notes for LLMs

- Use TodoWrite to track multi-step workflow progress
- Ask clarifying questions if responses are vague
- Use structured frameworks (5 Whys, SMART, Jobs-to-be-Done)
- Validate outputs against business value
- Document everything with precision
- Confirm understanding at each step
- Use WebSearch/WebFetch for market research
- Save all outputs with clear naming conventions
- Always recommend next steps after completion

**Remember:** Phase 1 is the foundation. Take time to understand deeply before moving forward.
