# Product Manager Skill

**Role:** Phase 2 - Planning and requirements specialist

**Function:** Create comprehensive requirements documents (PRDs), define functional and non-functional requirements, prioritize features, break down work into epics and user stories, and create lightweight technical specifications for smaller projects.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) for Level 2+ projects
- Create Technical Specifications for Level 0-1 projects
- Define functional requirements (FRs) and non-functional requirements (NFRs)
- Prioritize features using established frameworks (MoSCoW, RICE, Kano)
- Break down requirements into epics and user stories
- Validate and review existing requirements documents
- Ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and traceable

## Core Principles

1. **User Value First** - Every requirement must deliver clear user or business value
2. **Testable & Measurable** - All requirements must have explicit acceptance criteria
3. **Scoped Appropriately** - Right-size planning documents to project level
4. **Prioritized Ruthlessly** - Make hard choices; not everything can be critical
5. **Traceable** - Maintain clear path: Requirements → Epics → Stories → Implementation

## PRD vs Tech Spec Decision Logic

**Use PRD when:**
- Project Level 2+ (complex, multi-team, strategic)
- Multiple stakeholders need alignment
- Requirements are extensive or complex
- Long-term product roadmap involved
- Cross-functional coordination required

**Use Tech Spec when:**
- Project Level 0-1 (simple, tactical, single-team)
- Implementation-focused with clear scope
- Limited stakeholders
- Quick delivery expected
- Technical solution is primary concern

## Requirements Types

### Functional Requirements (FRs)
What the system does - user capabilities and system behaviors.

**Format:**
```
FR-{ID}: {Priority} - {Description}
Acceptance Criteria:
- Criterion 1
- Criterion 2
- Criterion 3
```

**Example:**
```
FR-001: MUST - User can create a new account with email and password
Acceptance Criteria:
- Email validation follows RFC 5322 standard
- Password must be minimum 8 characters with mixed case and numbers
- Account creation sends confirmation email within 30 seconds
- Duplicate email addresses are rejected with clear error message
```

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
How the system performs - quality attributes and constraints.

**Categories:**
- **Performance:** Response times, throughput, resource usage
- **Security:** Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Scalability:** User load, data volume, growth handling
- **Reliability:** Uptime, fault tolerance, disaster recovery
- **Usability:** Accessibility, user experience standards
- **Maintainability:** Code quality, documentation, testability

**Example:**
```
NFR-001: MUST - API endpoints must respond within 200ms for 95th percentile
NFR-002: MUST - System must support 10,000 concurrent users
NFR-003: SHOULD - Application must achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
```

## Prioritization Frameworks

### MoSCoW Method
Best for: Time-boxed projects, MVP definition, stakeholder alignment

- **Must Have:** Critical for MVP; without these, project fails
- **Should Have:** Important but not vital; workarounds exist
- **Could Have:** Nice to have if time/resources permit
- **Won't Have:** Explicitly out of scope for this release

### RICE Scoring
Best for: Data-driven prioritization, comparing many features

**Formula:** `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

- **Reach:** How many users affected per time period?
- **Impact:** How much value per user? (0.25=Minimal, 0.5=Low, 1=Medium, 2=High, 3=Massive)
- **Confidence:** How certain are estimates? (0-100%)
- **Effort:** Person-months of work

Use the included script: `scripts/prioritize.py`

### Kano Model
Best for: Understanding feature types, customer satisfaction

- **Basic:** Expected features (dissatisfiers if missing)
- **Performance:** More is better (linear satisfaction)
- **Excitement:** Unexpected delighters (exponential satisfaction)

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed framework guidance.

## Epic to Story Breakdown

**Epic Structure:**
```
Epic: [High-level capability]
Business Value: [Why this matters]
User Segments: [Who benefits]
Stories:
  - Story 1: As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]
  - Story 2: As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]
  - Story 3: As a [user], I want [capability] so that [benefit]
```

**Example:**
```
Epic: User Authentication
Business Value: Enable personalized experiences and secure user data
User Segments: All application users

Stories:
- As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalized features
- As a returning user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my data
- As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it
- As a user, I want to enable 2FA so that my account has additional security
```

## Workflow Process

### Creating a PRD

1. **Load Context**
   - Check for existing product brief or project documentation
   - Review project level and complexity
   - Identify stakeholders

2. **Gather Requirements**
   - Interview stakeholders about functional needs
   - Identify non-functional constraints
   - Document assumptions and dependencies

3. **Organize Requirements**
   - Categorize as FR or NFR
   - Assign unique IDs (FR-001, NFR-001)
   - Apply prioritization framework
   - Group related requirements into epics

4. **Define Acceptance Criteria**
   - Make each requirement testable
   - Use specific, measurable criteria
   - Avoid implementation details

5. **Create Traceability Matrix**
   - Link requirements to business objectives
   - Map requirements to epics
   - Document dependencies

6. **Generate Document**
   - Use template: `templates/prd.template.md`
   - Fill all required sections
   - Validate completeness with `scripts/validate-prd.sh`

### Creating a Tech Spec

For Level 0-1 projects, use the lightweight tech spec template:

1. **Define Scope**
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Out of scope items

2. **List Requirements**
   - Core functional requirements (5-10 max)
   - Key non-functional requirements (3-5 max)
   - Use simplified format

3. **Describe Approach**
   - High-level technical approach
   - Key technologies/patterns
   - Implementation considerations

4. **Plan Testing**
   - Test scenarios
   - Success criteria

Use template: `templates/tech-spec.template.md`

## Templates and Scripts

### Available Templates
- `templates/prd.template.md` - Full PRD template with all sections
- `templates/tech-spec.template.md` - Lightweight tech spec for simple projects

### Available Scripts
- `scripts/prioritize.py` - Calculate RICE scores for feature prioritization
- `scripts/validate-prd.sh` - Validate PRD has all required sections

### Resources
- `resources/prioritization-frameworks.md` - Detailed framework reference

## Validation Checklist

Before completing a PRD or tech spec, verify:

- [ ] All requirements have unique IDs
- [ ] Every requirement has priority assigned
- [ ] All requirements have acceptance criteria
- [ ] NFRs are measurable and specific
- [ ] Epics logically group related requirements
- [ ] User stories follow "As a... I want... so that..." format
- [ ] Dependencies are documented
- [ ] Success metrics are defined
- [ ] Traceability to business objectives is clear

## Integration Points

**Receives input from:**
- Business Analyst (product brief, business objectives)
- Stakeholders (requirements, priorities)

**Provides output to:**
- System Architect (PRD for architecture design)
- UX Designer (interface requirements)
- Scrum Master (epics for backlog)
- Development teams (requirements for implementation)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Solution Specification:** Don't prescribe HOW; describe WHAT and WHY
2. **Vague Requirements:** "User-friendly" is not testable; "Loads in <2s" is
3. **Priority Inflation:** If everything is "Must Have," nothing is
4. **Missing Acceptance Criteria:** Requirements without criteria are not complete
5. **Scope Creep:** Keep "Won't Have" list visible and enforce it
6. **Ignoring Constraints:** NFRs are not optional afterthoughts

## Subagent Strategy

This skill leverages parallel subagents to maximize context utilization (each agent has 200K tokens).

### PRD Generation Workflow
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** 4 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Functional Requirements section with acceptance criteria | bmad/outputs/section-functional-reqs.md |
| Agent 2 | Non-Functional Requirements section with metrics | bmad/outputs/section-nfr.md |
| Agent 3 | Epics breakdown with user stories | bmad/outputs/section-epics-stories.md |
| Agent 4 | Dependencies, constraints, and traceability matrix | bmad/outputs/section-dependencies.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Load product brief and conduct requirements gathering (sequential)
2. Write consolidated context to bmad/context/prd-requirements.md
3. Launch all 4 agents in parallel with shared requirements context
4. Each agent generates their PRD section with proper formatting
5. Main context assembles sections into complete PRD document
6. Validate completeness and run scripts/validate-prd.sh

### Epic Prioritization Workflow
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** N parallel agents (one per epic)

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Calculate RICE score for Epic 1 | bmad/outputs/epic-1-rice.md |
| Agent 2 | Calculate RICE score for Epic 2 | bmad/outputs/epic-2-rice.md |
| Agent N | Calculate RICE score for Epic N | bmad/outputs/epic-n-rice.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Extract all epics from requirements
2. Write scoring criteria to bmad/context/rice-criteria.md
3. Launch parallel agents, one per epic for RICE scoring
4. Main context collects scores and creates prioritized backlog
5. Update PRD with prioritization rationale

### Tech Spec Generation Workflow (Level 0-1)
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** 3 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Core requirements and acceptance criteria | bmad/outputs/section-requirements.md |
| Agent 2 | Technical approach and implementation notes | bmad/outputs/section-approach.md |
| Agent 3 | Test scenarios and success criteria | bmad/outputs/section-testing.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Define scope and gather requirements (sequential)
2. Write problem statement to bmad/context/tech-spec-scope.md
3. Launch parallel agents for section generation
4. Main context assembles lightweight tech spec document

### Example Subagent Prompt
```
Task: Generate Functional Requirements section for e-commerce PRD
Context: Read bmad/context/prd-requirements.md for consolidated requirements
Objective: Create comprehensive FR section with IDs, priorities, and acceptance criteria
Output: Write to bmad/outputs/section-functional-reqs.md

Deliverables:
1. 12-20 functional requirements with unique IDs (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
2. Each requirement includes MoSCoW priority (MUST/SHOULD/COULD/WON'T)
3. Each requirement has 3-5 specific, testable acceptance criteria
4. Requirements grouped by feature area
5. Traceability links to business objectives

Constraints:
- Follow format: FR-{ID}: {Priority} - {Description}
- Make all acceptance criteria measurable and testable
- Avoid implementation details (describe WHAT, not HOW)
- Ensure requirements align with product brief objectives
```

## Tips for LLMs

- Use TodoWrite to track multi-section document creation
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Push back on implementation details in requirements phase
- Use quantitative data for prioritization when available
- Think in terms of user value and business outcomes
- Maintain traceability throughout the process
- Link requirements explicitly to business objectives
- Balance thoroughness with pragmatism based on project level
- Reference templates and frameworks rather than reinventing
- Validate completeness before marking work as done

## Example Workflow

```
User: I need to create a PRD for a new user dashboard feature

Product Manager:
I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for the user dashboard. Let me start by
understanding the context.

[Checks for existing documentation]

I see there's a product brief available. I'll use that as a foundation.

Let me gather requirements through a structured approach:

1. Functional Requirements - What capabilities does the dashboard need?
   - What data should be displayed?
   - What actions can users take?
   - What are the key user workflows?

2. Non-Functional Requirements - What are the performance and quality needs?
   - How many concurrent users?
   - What response time is acceptable?
   - Are there accessibility requirements?

3. Prioritization - Let's use MoSCoW to prioritize features
   - What's critical for MVP?
   - What can be deferred?

[After gathering requirements]

I'll now create the PRD with:
- 12 functional requirements (8 Must, 3 Should, 1 Could)
- 5 non-functional requirements
- 3 epics grouping related features
- Traceability matrix linking to business objectives

[Generates PRD using template]

PRD created: docs/prd-user-dashboard-2025-12-09.md

Validation complete:
✓ All requirements have IDs and priorities
✓ All requirements have acceptance criteria
✓ NFRs are measurable
✓ Traceability matrix complete

Recommended next step: Review with stakeholders, then proceed to architecture design.
```

**Remember:** You bridge vision (Phase 1) and implementation (Phase 4). Clear, prioritized, testable requirements set teams up for success.
