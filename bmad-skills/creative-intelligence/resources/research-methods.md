## Research Types Overview

### Primary vs. Secondary Research

**Primary Research** - You conduct directly:
- Advantages: Specific to your needs, current, proprietary
- Disadvantages: Time-consuming, expensive, requires expertise
- Examples: User interviews, surveys, usability testing, A/B tests

**Secondary Research** - Using existing information:
- Advantages: Faster, cheaper, broader scope possible
- Disadvantages: May not fit your exact needs, could be outdated
- Examples: Market reports, competitor websites, academic papers, news articles

### Research Type Selection

| Goal | Type | Primary/Secondary | Duration |
|------|------|-------------------|----------|
| Understand market size | Market | Secondary | 2-4 hours |
| Identify competitors | Competitive | Secondary | 1-3 hours |
| Compare technologies | Technical | Secondary | 2-5 hours |
| Validate user needs | User | Primary + Secondary | 4-8 hours |
| Test feature concepts | User | Primary | 3-6 hours |
| Analyze competitor features | Competitive | Secondary | 2-4 hours |

| Feature 2 | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | 2 missing |
| Feature 3 | Planned | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ⭐ Opportunity |
| Feature 4 | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | We're behind |

**Pricing comparison:**

| Tier | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
|------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Free/Trial | 14 days | 30 days | Forever free | 7 days |
| Entry | $15/user | $12/user | $10/user | $20/user |
| Professional | $29/user | $25/user | $25/user | $49/user |

## Best Practices

### Research Best Practices

1. **Start with secondary research**
   - Faster and cheaper than primary
   - Builds foundation for primary research
   - Identifies gaps that need primary research

2. **Triangulate findings**
   - Verify across multiple sources
   - Look for consensus and outliers
   - Question single-source claims

3. **Check source credibility**
   - Who published this and why?
   - When was it published? (recency matters)
   - Is there potential bias?
   - Is methodology sound?

4. **Document as you go**
   - Don't wait until the end
   - Capture sources immediately
   - Record search queries used
   - Note dead ends (save future time)

5. **Quantify when possible**
   - Numbers are more actionable than adjectives
   - "67% of users" > "most users"
   - "$2.1B market" > "large market"

6. **Time-box research**
   - Research can be endless
   - Set clear time limits
   - Focus on decisions to be made
   - Perfect information is impossible

7. **Synthesize, don't just compile**
   - Raw data isn't insight
   - Look for patterns and themes
   - Extract actionable insights
   - "So what?" - what does this mean?

8. **Consider what's missing**
   - What aren't sources saying?
   - Who isn't represented?
   - What gaps exist?
   - Where's the bias?

9. **Update regularly**
   - Markets and tech change quickly
   - Set research expiration dates
   - Quarterly updates for strategic research
   - Annual deep dives

10. **Share widely**
    - Research benefits entire organization
    - Create searchable knowledge base
    - Present findings to stakeholders
    - Archive for future reference

### Common Research Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Confirmation bias**
- Problem: Only seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
- Solution: Actively look for contradictory information

**Mistake 2: Outdated information**
- Problem: Using old research in fast-moving fields
- Solution: Check publication dates, prioritize recent sources

**Mistake 3: Single-source reliance**
- Problem: Basing decisions on one source
- Solution: Triangulate across multiple sources

**Mistake 4: Not documenting sources**
- Problem: Can't verify or return to original sources
- Solution: Document URLs, access dates, key quotes immediately

**Mistake 5: Analysis paralysis**
- Problem: Endless research without decisions
- Solution: Time-box research, set "good enough" threshold

**Mistake 6: Asking leading questions (in primary research)**
- Problem: "Don't you think this feature would be useful?"
- Solution: "How do you currently handle [problem]?"

**Mistake 7: Small sample sizes (in quantitative research)**
- Problem: Drawing conclusions from 3 user interviews
- Solution: Use appropriate sample sizes or acknowledge limitations

**Mistake 8: Ignoring contrary evidence**
- Problem: Cherry-picking data that supports preferred direction
- Solution: Document all findings, explain contradictions

## Conclusion

Effective research is:
- **Focused:** Clear questions drive efficient research
- **Systematic:** Follow structured processes
- **Rigorous:** Triangulate, verify, question
- **Actionable:** Extract insights that inform decisions
- **Documented:** Create searchable, shareable knowledge
- **Time-bound:** Perfect information is impossible; good enough is achievable

Use these methods, leverage the right tools, and document thoroughly. That's the path to research-driven decision-making.
