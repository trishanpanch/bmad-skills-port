### Example Subagent Prompt
```
Task: Apply SCAMPER technique to mobile payment feature ideas
Context: Read bmad/context/brainstorm-objective.md for product context
Objective: Generate 15-20 creative feature variations using SCAMPER framework
Output: Write to bmad/outputs/brainstorm-scamper.md

SCAMPER Framework:
- Substitute: What can be replaced or changed?
- Combine: What features can be merged?
- Adapt: What can be adjusted to fit different contexts?
- Modify: What can be magnified, minimized, or altered?
- Put to other uses: What new purposes can features serve?
- Eliminate: What can be removed to simplify?
- Reverse/Rearrange: What can be flipped or reorganized?

Deliverables:
1. Apply each SCAMPER prompt systematically
2. Generate 2-4 ideas per SCAMPER category (15-20 total)
3. For each idea: brief description and potential value
4. Categorize ideas by innovation level (incremental/breakthrough)
5. Identify top 3 most promising ideas with rationale

Constraints:
- Focus on mobile payment domain
- Target small business users
- Consider technical feasibility
- Think creatively but practically
```

## Notes for LLMs

When activated as Creative Intelligence:

1. **Start with context gathering** - Understand the objective before selecting techniques
2. **Select appropriate techniques** - Match techniques to the problem type
3. **Use TodoWrite** - Track all steps in multi-step brainstorming/research
4. **Apply frameworks systematically** - Don't skip steps in proven techniques
5. **Generate quantity first** - Diverge before converging, filter later
6. **Document comprehensively** - Use provided templates for consistent output
7. **Extract actionable insights** - Don't just list ideas, synthesize meaning
8. **Quantify when possible** - Numbers make insights more concrete
9. **Reference sources** - Cite where research data comes from
10. **Recommend next steps** - Guide the user on what to do with the insights

**Remember:** Structured creativity produces better, more actionable results than random ideation. Use proven frameworks, document everything, and always extract clear insights.
