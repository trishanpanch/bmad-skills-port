# BMAD Method Project Configuration

This project uses the **BMAD Method** (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) - a structured, phase-based approach to software development with AI assistance.

## When to Use BMAD Skills

Activate the appropriate BMAD skill when the user:

- Needs "design tokens" or "design system"

### creative-intelligence
- Wants to "brainstorm" using specific techniques
- Asks for "SCAMPER", "SWOT", or "mind mapping"
- Needs "research" (market, competitive, technical)
- Wants "creative solutions" or "ideation"
- Mentions "Six Thinking Hats" or "Starbursting"

### builder
- Wants to "create a custom agent" or "skill"
- Needs a "custom workflow"
- Asks to "extend BMAD" or "customize"
- Wants to create "templates"
- Mentions "building" new BMAD components

## BMAD Phases Overview

```
Phase 1: Analysis      → business-analyst, creative-intelligence
Phase 2: Planning      → product-manager, ux-designer
Phase 3: Solutioning   → system-architect, ux-designer
Phase 4: Implementation → scrum-master, developer
```

## Project Levels

| Level | Scope | Typical Stories | Required Docs |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| 0 | Single atomic change | 1 | Tech Spec only |
| 1 | Small feature | 1-10 | Tech Spec |
| 2 | Medium feature set | 5-15 | PRD + Architecture |
| 3 | Complex integration | 12-40 | PRD + Architecture |
| 4 | Enterprise expansion | 40+ | PRD + Architecture |

## Subagent Strategy

All BMAD skills leverage **parallel subagents** to maximize the 200K token context window per agent. When executing complex workflows:

1. **Decompose** the task into independent subtasks
2. **Launch** parallel agents using the Task tool with `run_in_background: true`
3. **Coordinate** by writing shared context to `bmad/context/`
4. **Synthesize** results from `bmad/outputs/`

See `SUBAGENT-PATTERNS.md` for detailed patterns.

## Quick Commands

When in a BMAD-initialized project, these workflows are available:

**Phase 1 - Analysis:**
- `/product-brief` - Create product brief
- `/brainstorm` - Structured brainstorming session
- `/research` - Market/competitive research

**Phase 2 - Planning:**
- `/prd` - Create Product Requirements Document
- `/tech-spec` - Create Technical Specification
- `/create-ux-design` - Create UX design

**Phase 3 - Solutioning:**
- `/architecture` - Design system architecture
- `/solutioning-gate-check` - Validate architecture

**Phase 4 - Implementation:**
- `/sprint-planning` - Plan sprints from requirements
- `/create-story` - Create detailed user story
- `/dev-story STORY-ID` - Implement a story

**Status:**
- `/workflow-status` or `/status` - Check project progress

## File Structure

When BMAD is initialized in a project:

```
project/
├── bmad/
│   ├── config.yaml              # Project configuration
│   ├── context/                 # Shared context for subagents
│   └── outputs/                 # Subagent outputs
├── docs/
│   ├── bmm-workflow-status.yaml # Workflow progress tracking
│   ├── sprint-status.yaml       # Sprint tracking (Phase 4)
│   ├── stories/                 # User story documents
│   ├── product-brief-*.md       # Phase 1 outputs
│   ├── prd-*.md                 # Phase 2 outputs
│   ├── tech-spec-*.md           # Phase 2 outputs
│   └── architecture-*.md        # Phase 3 outputs
└── .claude/
    └── commands/bmad/           # Project-specific commands
```

## Integration Notes

- Use **TodoWrite** to track multi-step workflows
- Use **Task** tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for parallel work
- Reference skill scripts for deterministic operations
- Update workflow status after completing each phase
- Hand off between skills at phase boundaries

## Getting Started

If the project doesn't have BMAD initialized:

```
User: Initialize BMAD for this project
→ Activates bmad-orchestrator
→ Creates bmad/ and docs/ structure
→ Sets project level and type
→ Recommends first workflow
```

If BMAD is already initialized:

```
User: What's my project status?
→ Activates bmad-orchestrator
→ Reads bmm-workflow-status.yaml
→ Shows completed/pending workflows
→ Recommends next step
```
