3. **Week 2, Days 1-2:** {STORY-XXX} - {Title}
   - Rationale: {Why this story here}

4. **Week 2, Days 3-5:** {STORY-XXX} - {Title}
   - Rationale: {Why this story last}

## Story Dependencies

| {Start Date} | 0 | {Total} | {Total} | Sprint begins |
| {Date} | {X} | {Y} | {Ideal} | {Any blockers or notes} |
| {Date} | {X} | {Y} | {Ideal} | {Any blockers or notes} |
| {End Date} | {Total} | 0 | 0 | Sprint complete |

## Sprint Plan Template Usage

### Creating a Sprint Plan:
1. Fill in sprint metadata (number, dates, capacity)
2. List all stories grouped by epic
3. Assign priorities (Must/Should/Could Have)
4. Calculate total points and verify against capacity
5. Define clear sprint goal
6. Identify dependencies and critical path
7. Plan implementation sequence
8. Identify risks and mitigation strategies

### Capacity Planning:
- **New team:** Use dev-days × points/day (2-3 pts/day)
- **After Sprint 1:** Use Sprint 1 actual velocity
- **After Sprint 3+:** Use 3-sprint rolling average (recommended)

### Sprint Goal Best Practices:
- **Specific:** Clear what will be achieved
- **Achievable:** Realistic given capacity
- **Valuable:** Delivers user or business value
- **Testable:** Can verify goal is met
- **Example:** "Complete user authentication (registration, login, password reset)"

### Priority Guidelines:
- **Must Have:** 60-70% of capacity
- **Should Have:** 20-30% of capacity
- **Could Have:** 10% of capacity (buffer for velocity variance)

### Adjusting Mid-Sprint:
- If behind: Remove "Could Have" stories
- If ahead: Pull in next sprint's top priority story
- Don't add unplanned work without removing equal points
- Focus on sprint goal, not just completing points
