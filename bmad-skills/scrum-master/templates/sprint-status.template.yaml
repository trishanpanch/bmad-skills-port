# Sprint Status YAML Usage Guide

## File Location
Store this file at: `.bmad/sprint-status.yaml`

## Updating Sprint Status

### During Sprint Planning:
1. Create new sprint entry with stories
2. Set `status: not_started`
3. Define sprint goal and capacity
4. List all stories with estimates

### During Sprint:
1. Update story statuses as work progresses
2. Add burndown tracking data points
3. Update metrics (completed/remaining points)
4. Log any risks or blockers
5. Set current sprint: `current_sprint: N`

### After Sprint:
1. Set `status: completed`
2. Calculate final velocity
3. Add to velocity_history
4. Update 3-sprint average
5. Record retrospective notes
6. Plan next sprint

## Story Status Values

- **not_started:** Story is in backlog, not begun
- **in_progress:** Actively being worked on
- **in_review:** Code review or testing
- **blocked:** Work stopped due to blocker
- **completed:** All acceptance criteria met, deployed

## Priority Values

- **Must Have:** Critical for sprint goal
- **Should Have:** Important, but not critical
- **Could Have:** Nice to have, can be deferred
- **Won't Have:** Explicitly out of scope

## Health Indicators

### velocity_on_track
- `true` if current completion rate will meet capacity
- `false` if behind pace (may not complete all stories)

### burndown_on_track
- `true` if burndown tracking close to ideal line
- `false` if significantly above/below ideal

### team_morale
- `high`: Team is energized, productive, collaborative
- `medium`: Team is functional, some concerns
- `low`: Team is struggling, burnout risk, needs intervention

## Calculating Metrics

### Completion Percentage
```
completion_percentage = (completed_points / total_points) * 100
```

### Three-Sprint Average
```
average = (sprint1 + sprint2 + sprint3) / 3
```

### Completion Rate
```
completion_rate = (completed_points / planned_points) * 100
```

## Automation Scripts

### Update Velocity
```bash
python scripts/calculate-velocity.py .bmad/sprint-status.yaml
```

### Generate Burndown Data
```bash
python scripts/sprint-burndown.py .bmad/sprint-status.yaml
```

### Generate Next Story ID
```bash
bash scripts/generate-story-id.sh project-name
```

## Best Practices

1. **Update daily:** Refresh metrics and burndown data daily during sprint
2. **Track blockers immediately:** Don't wait for standup to log blockers
3. **Be honest about status:** Accurate data enables better planning
4. **Review velocity trends:** Look for patterns over 3+ sprints
5. **Capture retrospective notes:** Document learnings while fresh
6. **Use consistent definitions:** Ensure team agrees on status values
7. **Backup regularly:** This file is critical project data
8. **Version control:** Commit changes to track history

## Example Queries

### Current sprint velocity:
```yaml
sprints[current_sprint].metrics.completed_points
```

### Stories blocked:
```yaml
sprints[current_sprint].stories[status=blocked]
```

### Three-sprint average:
```yaml
velocity_metrics.three_sprint_average
```

### Project completion:
```yaml
project_progress.progress_percentage
```
