# BMAD Orchestrator

**Purpose:** Core orchestrator for the BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development), managing workflows, tracking status, and routing users through structured development phases.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User requests `/workflow-init` or `/init` - Initialize BMAD in a project
- User requests `/workflow-status` or `/status` - Check progress and get recommendations
- User mentions "BMAD setup" or "start BMAD workflow"
- Project needs structured development methodology
- Coordination between multiple development phases is required

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Project Initialization** - Set up BMAD directory structure and configuration
2. **Status Tracking** - Monitor progress across 4 development phases
3. **Workflow Routing** - Direct users to appropriate next steps based on project state
4. **Progress Management** - Maintain workflow status and completion tracking

## BMAD Method Overview

### 4 Development Phases

1. **Analysis** (Optional) - Research, brainstorming, product brief
2. **Planning** (Required) - PRD or Tech Spec based on project complexity
3. **Solutioning** (Conditional) - Architecture design for medium+ projects
4. **Implementation** (Required) - Sprint planning, stories, development

### Project Levels

- **Level 0:** Single atomic change (1 story) - Quick fixes, small tweaks
- **Level 1:** Small feature (1-10 stories) - Single feature additions
- **Level 2:** Medium feature set (5-15 stories) - Multiple related features
- **Level 3:** Complex integration (12-40 stories) - System integrations
- **Level 4:** Enterprise expansion (40+ stories) - Large-scale projects

**Planning Requirements by Level:**
- Level 0-1: Tech Spec required, PRD optional/recommended
- Level 2+: PRD required, Tech Spec optional
- Level 2+: Architecture required

## Available Commands

### /workflow-init or /init

Initialize BMAD structure in the current project.

**Steps:**
1. Create directory structure:
   ```
   bmad/
   ├── config.yaml
   └── agent-overrides/

   docs/
   ├── bmm-workflow-status.yaml
   └── stories/

   .claude/commands/bmad/ (if not exists)
   ```

2. Collect project information:
   - Project name
   - Project type (web-app, mobile-app, api, game, library, other)
   - Project level (0-4)

3. Create project config using [config.template.yaml](templates/config.template.yaml)

4. Create workflow status file with conditional requirements based on level:
   - Use [workflow-status template](templates/config.template.yaml)
   - Set PRD: required if level >= 2, else recommended
   - Set Tech-spec: required if level <= 1, else optional
   - Set Architecture: required if level >= 2, else optional

5. Display initialization summary and recommend next workflow

6. Offer to start recommended workflow

**Example interaction:**
```
User: /workflow-init

Orchestrator: I'll initialize BMAD for your project.
[Collects info, creates files...]

✓ BMAD Method initialized!

Project: MyApp
Type: web-app
Level: 2 (Medium feature set)

Configuration: bmad/config.yaml
Status tracking: docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml

Recommended next step: Create Product Brief with /product-brief
This will help define your product vision and requirements.

Would you like to start with /product-brief?
```

### /workflow-status or /status

Check project status and get recommendations for next steps.

**Steps:**
1. Load project config (bmad/config.yaml)
2. Load workflow status (docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml)
3. Determine current phase and next recommended workflow
4. Display status with visual indicators
5. Offer to execute recommended workflow

**Status Indicators:**
- ✓ = Completed (shows file path)
- ⚠ = Required but not started
- → = Current phase
- - = Optional/not required

**Example interaction:**
```
User: /status

Orchestrator: Checking your project status...

Project: MyApp (Web Application, Level 2)

✓ Phase 1: Analysis
  ✓ product-brief (docs/product-brief-myapp-2025-01-11.md)

→ Phase 2: Planning [CURRENT]
  ⚠ prd (required - NOT STARTED)
  - tech-spec (optional)

Phase 3: Solutioning
  - architecture (required)

Phase 4: Implementation
  - sprint-planning (required)

Recommended next step: Create PRD with /prd command

Would you like to run /prd to create your PRD?
```

**If project not initialized:**
- Inform user BMAD not detected
- Offer to run `/workflow-init`

## Workflow Routing Logic

After determining project status, route users to specialized workflows:

- **Analysis workflows:** `/product-brief`, `/brainstorm`, `/research`
- **Planning workflows:** `/prd`, `/tech-spec`
- **UX workflows:** `/create-ux-design`
- **Architecture workflows:** `/architecture`
- **Sprint workflows:** `/sprint-planning`, `/create-story`
- **Development workflows:** `/dev-story`, `/code-review`

**Recommendation logic:**
1. If no product-brief and project new → Recommend: `/product-brief`
2. If product-brief complete, no PRD/tech-spec:
   - Level 0-1 → Recommend: `/tech-spec`
   - Level 2+ → Recommend: `/prd`
3. If PRD/tech-spec complete, no architecture, level 2+ → Recommend: `/architecture`
4. If planning complete → Recommend: `/sprint-planning`
5. If sprint active → Recommend: `/create-story` or `/dev-story`

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed routing logic.

## Configuration Files

### Project Config (bmad/config.yaml)
```yaml
project_name: "MyApp"
project_type: "web-app"  # web-app, mobile-app, api, game, library, other
project_level: 2         # 0-4
output_folder: "docs"
communication_language: "English"
```

### Workflow Status (docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml)
Tracks completion of each workflow with status values:
- `"optional"` - Can be skipped
- `"recommended"` - Strongly suggested
- `"required"` - Must be completed
- `"{file-path}"` - Completed (shows output file)
- `"skipped"` - Explicitly skipped

See [templates/config.template.yaml](templates/config.template.yaml) for full template.

## Helper Scripts

Execute via Bash tool:

- **init-project.sh** - Automated project initialization
  ```bash
  bash scripts/init-project.sh --name "MyApp" --type web-app --level 2
  ```

- **check-status.sh** - Display current workflow status
  ```bash
  bash scripts/check-status.sh
  ```

- **validate-config.sh** - Validate YAML configuration
  ```bash
  bash scripts/validate-config.sh bmad/config.yaml
  ```

See [scripts documentation](resources/workflow-phases.md) for details.

## Error Handling

**Config missing:**
- Suggest `/workflow-init`
- Explain BMAD not initialized

**Invalid YAML:**
- Show error location
- Offer to fix or reinitialize

**Template missing:**
- Use inline fallback
- Log warning
- Continue operation

**Status file inconsistent:**
- Validate against project level
- Offer to regenerate

## Integration with Other Skills

This orchestrator coordinates with specialized BMAD skills:
- `bmad-analyst` - Analysis phase workflows
- `bmad-planner` - Planning phase workflows
- `bmad-architect` - Architecture design
- `bmad-sprint-master` - Sprint and story management
- `bmad-developer` - Development workflows

When routing to these skills, pass context:
- Current project config
- Workflow status
- Project level
- Output folder location

## Token Optimization

- Use script automation for repetitive tasks
- Reference REFERENCE.md for detailed logic
- Load files only when needed
- Keep status displays concise
- Delegate detailed work to specialized skills

## Subagent Strategy

This skill leverages parallel subagents to maximize context utilization (each agent has 200K tokens).

### Workflow Status Check Workflow
**Pattern:** Fan-Out Research
**Agents:** 3-4 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Check project config and validate structure | bmad/outputs/config-status.md |
| Agent 2 | Analyze workflow status file and phase completion | bmad/outputs/workflow-status.md |
| Agent 3 | Scan docs directory for completed artifacts | bmad/outputs/artifacts-status.md |
| Agent 4 | Generate recommendations based on project level | bmad/outputs/recommendations.md |

**Coordination:**
1. Launch all agents with shared project context
2. Each agent writes status findings to designated output
3. Main context synthesizes results into unified status report
4. Display visual status indicators and next steps

### Project Initialization Workflow
**Pattern:** Parallel Section Generation
**Agents:** 3 parallel agents

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| Agent 1 | Create directory structure and validate paths | bmad/outputs/directory-setup.md |
| Agent 2 | Generate project config from template | bmad/config.yaml |
| Agent 3 | Generate workflow status file with level-based requirements | docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml |

**Coordination:**
1. Gather project information from user (sequential)
2. Launch parallel agents to create structures and configs
3. Main context validates all outputs and displays summary

### Example Subagent Prompt
```
Task: Analyze workflow status and determine current phase
Context: Read bmad/config.yaml and docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml
Objective: Identify completed workflows, current phase, and required next steps
Output: Write analysis to bmad/outputs/workflow-status.md

Deliverables:
1. List of completed workflows with file paths
2. Current phase determination
3. Required vs optional next workflows
4. Blocking issues or missing dependencies

Constraints:
- Use project level to determine requirements
- Flag any inconsistencies in status file
```

## Notes for Claude

- This is the entry point for BMAD workflows
- Always check if project is initialized before operations
- Maintain phase-based progression (don't skip required phases)
- Use TodoWrite for multi-step initialization
- Keep responses focused and actionable
- Hand off to specialized skills for detailed workflows
- Update workflow status after completing workflows
