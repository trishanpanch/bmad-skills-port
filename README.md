## 🌟 What Makes BMAD v6 Different

### vs. Traditional Agile

| Feature | Traditional | BMAD v6 |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Context Loss** | Constant re-explaining | Persistent YAML status + helpers.md |
| **Agent Switching** | Manual role switching | Automatic skill loading by command |
| **Documentation** | Scattered, outdated | Structured, template-based, in-repo |
| **Token Usage** | High redundancy | 70-85% optimized with helpers |
| **Workflow** | Ad-hoc | Structured 4-phase process |
| **Extensibility** | Limited | Builder module for custom agents |
| **Creativity** | Manual | Structured brainstorming + research |
| **UX Design** | Separate tools | Integrated with accessibility |

### vs. BMAD Method (Original npm Package)

| Feature | BMAD npm | BMAD v6 (Claude Code) |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| **Dependencies** | Node.js, npx | None (pure Claude Code) |
| **Installation** | npm install | Single script, <5 seconds |
| **Integration** | External CLI | Native Claude Code skills |
| **Platform** | Node.js only | Windows, Linux, macOS, WSL |
| **Token Usage** | Standard | 70-85% optimized |
| **Personas** | Character-based | Functional (no persona overhead) |
| **Commands** | CLI flags | Slash commands (/) |
| **Extensibility** | Limited | Builder module |
| **Creativity** | Manual | /brainstorm, /research |
| **UX Design** | Not included | /create-ux-design |

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Token Optimization

**Helper Pattern (70-75% savings):**
```markdown
# Instead of embedding this 200+ times:
"Load config from ~/.claude/config/bmad/config.yaml
Parse YAML to extract user_name, language, output_folder..."

# Commands reference once:
"Per helpers.md#Load-Global-Config"
```

**Result:**
- 15 commands reference 1 helpers.md file
- ~81% reduction in total token usage
- Single source of truth for common operations

**No Personas (15-30% savings):**
```markdown
# Before (persona overhead):
You are Mary, the Business Analyst. Mary is detail-oriented and loves
uncovering user needs. She's worked on 50+ projects and brings enthusiasm...

# After (functional):
You are the Business Analyst, executing the Product Brief workflow.
```

**Result:**
- 150-200 tokens saved per skill
- 750-1,000 tokens saved per conversation
- Focus on WHAT to do, not WHO is doing it

**Combined Optimization: 85-105% vs. traditional approach**

---

### Project Levels (Right-Sizing)

BMAD automatically adjusts workflows based on project complexity:

| Level | Stories | Planning | Commands |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|
| **0** | 1 story | Minimal | `/product-brief` → `/tech-spec` → `/dev-story` |
| **1** | 1-10 | Light | `/product-brief` → `/tech-spec` → `/create-story` |
| **2** | 5-15 | Standard | `/product-brief` → `/prd` → `/architecture` |
| **3** | 12-40 | Comprehensive | Full BMAD (all phases) |
| **4** | 40+ | Enterprise | Full BMAD + sprint planning |

**Prevents:**
- Over-planning small projects
- Under-planning large projects
- Wasted effort on wrong level of detail

---

### Status Tracking

**YAML-based status files:**

```yaml
# bmad-outputs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml
project_level: 2
last_workflow: architecture
last_workflow_date: "2025-11-01"

phase_1_analysis:
  product_brief_completed: true
  product_brief_date: "2025-10-28"

phase_2_planning:
  prd_completed: true
  prd_date: "2025-10-29"
  functional_requirements_count: 24
  nfr_requirements_count: 8

phase_3_solutioning:
  architecture_completed: true
  architecture_date: "2025-11-01"
  gate_check_passed: true
  gate_check_score: 95

phase_4_implementation:
  sprints_planned: 3
  stories_created: 12
  stories_completed: 5
```

**Benefits:**
- Persistent context across sessions
- No re-explaining project state
- Workflow recommendations based on status
- Progress tracking

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Installation Issues

#### PowerShell v6.0.1 Update (2025-11-12)

The installer has been completely rewritten to fix common errors. If you're experiencing issues:

**1. Run diagnostics first:**
```powershell
.\install-v6.ps1 -Verbose
```

This will show detailed diagnostic output including exactly where the installation fails.

**2. Dry-run to test without installing:**
```powershell
.\install-v6.ps1 -WhatIf
```

This shows what would be installed without actually doing it.

**3. Force reinstall over existing:**
```powershell
.\install-v6.ps1 -Force
```

**4. Clean uninstall:**
```powershell
.\install-v6.ps1 -Uninstall
```

---

### Common PowerShell Errors

**"Scripts disabled" (Windows PowerShell):**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\install-v6.ps1
```

**"Cannot find path" errors:**

This means the script can't find the `bmad-v6/` directory. Make sure you're running the installer from the repository root:

```powershell
# Check if you're in the right directory
dir bmad-v6\

# If not found, navigate to repository root
cd path\to\claude-code-bmad-skills
.\install-v6.ps1
```

**"Access denied" / "Permission denied":**

The installer needs write access to your home directory. Try:

```powershell
# Check if you have write permissions
Test-Path -Path $env:USERPROFILE -PathType Container -IsValid

# If running in restricted environment, run PowerShell as Administrator
# Right-click PowerShell -> "Run as Administrator"
```

**PowerShell 5.0 detected:**

PowerShell 5.1 or newer is recommended. Download from:
https://aka.ms/wmf5download

The installer will still try to work with 5.0, but upgrade for best compatibility.

**"Copy-Item: Cannot find path":**

This error is now fixed in v6.0.1. The installer creates destination directories before copying.

If you still see this error with v6.0.1, run with `-Verbose` and report the issue.

---

### Linux/macOS/WSL Installation Issues

**"Permission denied":**
```bash
chmod +x install-v6.sh
./install-v6.sh
```

**Git not found:**
```bash
# Install git first
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install git

# macOS:
brew install git
```

**"No such file or directory" for bmad-v6/:**

Make sure you're in the repository root:
```bash
ls -la bmad-v6/
cd /path/to/claude-code-bmad-skills
./install-v6.sh
```

---

### Skills Not Loading

**Check installation:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS/WSL
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/bmad/core/bmad-master/SKILL.md

# Windows PowerShell
dir $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\bmad\core\bmad-master\SKILL.md
```

If the file doesn't exist, installation failed. Run the installer with `-Verbose` (PowerShell) or check error output.

**Restart Claude Code** - Skills load on startup, not mid-session.

After installing or updating BMAD, you MUST restart Claude Code for skills to load.

---

### Commands Not Working

**Initialize BMAD first:**
```
/workflow-init
```

Commands require BMAD structure in your project. If `/workflow-init` doesn't work:

1. Check that skills are installed (see "Skills Not Loading" above)
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Verify BMAD Master skill loaded by checking Claude Code startup messages

**Check project-level config exists:**
```bash
ls -la bmad-outputs/project-config.yaml
```

---

### Installation Verification

After installation, verify everything is working:

**1. Check files exist:**

Linux/macOS/WSL:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/bmad/core/bmad-master/SKILL.md
ls -la ~/.claude/config/bmad/config.yaml
ls -la ~/.claude/config/bmad/helpers.md
```

Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
dir $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\bmad\core\bmad-master\SKILL.md
dir $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\config\bmad\config.yaml
dir $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\config\bmad\helpers.md
```

**2. Check directory structure:**

```bash
# Should show: core/, bmm/, bmb/, cis/
ls ~/.claude/skills/bmad/

# Should show: agents/, templates/, config.yaml, helpers.md
ls ~/.claude/config/bmad/
```

**3. Restart Claude Code and test:**

```
/workflow-status
```

If this command works, BMAD is installed correctly!

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Start with /workflow-init
Always initialize BMAD in your project first. This creates necessary structure.

### 2. Follow the phases
Don't skip directly to implementation. Requirements → Architecture → Development produces better results.

### 3. Use project levels appropriately
- Small prototype? Use Level 0 (`/tech-spec`)
- Full product? Use Level 2+ (`/prd` → `/architecture`)

### 4. Leverage status tracking
Run `/workflow-status` to see where you are and what to do next.

### 5. Extend when needed
Need QA workflows? Use `/create-agent` to build a QA Engineer.
Need deployment workflows? Use `/create-workflow` to create custom commands.

### 6. Brainstorm before deciding
Use `/brainstorm` with multiple techniques before making big decisions.

### 7. Research before building
Use `/research` to validate assumptions and learn from competitors.

### 8. Design before coding
Use `/create-ux-design` to think through user experience before implementation.
